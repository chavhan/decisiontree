File Structure:
readme.txt
company_analysis
company_decision
fraud_check
fraud_check_decision
analysis_ctree
iris_ctree
total_result

Development Environment:
My script was developed RStudio Version 1.3.1056

Usage:
Install RStudio. Open file in RStudio and change the code according to you dataset for various situations and run it.


File Description 
company_decision- file in R language covering objective of company dataset
company_analysis- This file contains the different outcome of r function to observe the output and act accordingly on company dataset
fraud_check_decision- file in R language covering objective of fraud dataset
fraud_check- This file contains the different outcome of r function to observe the output and act accordingly on fraud dataset
iris_ctree- file in R language covering objective of bydefault dataset
analysis_ctree- This file contains the different outcome of r function to observe the output and act accordingly on fraud dataset
total_result - It is an set of results of accuracy figure on company/fraud/iris dataset 



objective:- 
(1) company dataset - A cloth manufacturing company is interested to know about the segment or attributes causes high sale. 
(2) Fraud dataset - Use decision trees to prepare a model on fraud data, treating those who have taxable_income <= 30000 as "Risky" and others are "Good"
(3) iris dataset- prediction right type of species. 

Note :- I have added some png files which are the different graphs on both the datasets for EDA and result observation purpose. Also added the snapshot dataset.
